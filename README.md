# Klaviyo (Source)

This package models Klaviyo data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/klaviyo). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/klaviyo#schemainformation).

This package enriches your Fivetran data by doing the following:
* Adds descriptions to tables and columns that are synced using Fivetran
* Adds column-level testing where applicable. For example, all primary keys are tested for uniqueness and non-null values.
* Models staging tables, which will be used in our transform package

## Models

This package contains staging models, designed to work simultaneously with our [Klaviyo modeling package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo).  The staging models:
* Remove any rows that are soft-deleted
* Name columns consistently across all packages:
    * Boolean fields are prefixed with `is_` or `has_`
    * Timestamps are appended with `_at`
    * ID primary keys are prefixed with the name of the table.  For example, a user table's ID column is renamed user_id.
    * Foreign keys include the table that they refer to. For example, a project table's owner ID column is renamed owner_user_id.
* [anything else?]

## Installation Instructions
Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

## Configuration
By default, this package looks for your Klaviyo data in the `klaviyo` schema of your [target database](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile). If this is not where your Klaviyo data is, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
    klaviyo_database: your_database_name
    klaviyo_schema: your_schema_name 
```

### Passthrough Columns
Additionally, this package includes all source columns defined in the macros folder. We highly recommend including custom fields in this package as models now only bring in ~~a few~~ the standard fields for the `EVENT` and `PERSON` tables. You can add more columns using our pass-through column variables. These variables allow for the pass-through fields to be aliased (`alias`) and casted (`transform_sql`) if desired, but not required. Datatype casting is configured via a sql snippet within the `transform_sql` key. You may add the desired sql while omitting the `as field_name` at the end and your custom pass-though fields will be casted accordingly. Use the below format for declaring the respective pass-through variables.

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
vars:

  klaviyo__event_pass_through_columns:
    - name:           "property_field_id"
      alias:          "new_name_for_this_field_id"
      transform_sql:  "cast(new_name_for_this_field as int64)"
    - name:           "this_other_field"
      transform_sql:  "cast(this_other_field as string)"
  klaviyo__person_pass_through_columns:
    - name:           "custom_crazy_field_name"
      alias:          "normal_field_name"
```

### Changing the Build Schema
By default this package will build the Iterable staging models within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_stg_klaviyo`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like you Klaviyo staging data to be written to, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
models:
    klaviyo_source:
        +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```
